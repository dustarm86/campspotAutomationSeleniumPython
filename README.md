# campspotTakeHomeAssignmentSeleniumPython
campspot's take-home assignment for automating a test case scenario using selenium webdriver and python.

how to install selenium webdriver on macOS to use with Python:
pip3 install selenium

1st note: this project requires Python3 to be installed on your OS
2nd note: due to defects that I have logged, the automation script I have written will not work against the "developmentURL" variable until a developer fixes the issues with the inputs "Location", "Dates", and "Guests". For the purpose of this automation demo, the production variable "productionUrl" is used.
